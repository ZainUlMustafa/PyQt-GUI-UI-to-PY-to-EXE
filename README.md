# PyQt-GUI-UI-to-PY-to-EXE
<b>This app is created in Python</b>
<h2>How to use this?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure PyQt4 is properly installed. Use pip freeze to list the installed packages</li>
<li>Install PyInstaller: pip install pyinstaller</li>
<li>Run the app: open the main.py and run it using your IDE or simply open EasyConverter.exe</li>
</ul>

<b>NOTE</b>
<p>I have created the EasyConverter.exe app by using my python code onto itself. main.py is the main python script that does all this conversion. I simply created its exe using itself for my easy. You can use it as well.</p>
<b>Remember</b> if EasyConverter.exe doesn't run, you can double click the main.py and use it for your conversion.</p>
<p>On Linux and Mac, you have to use main.py as .exe won't work there!</p>
